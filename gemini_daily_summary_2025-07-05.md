## Gemini Daily Summary - 2025-07-05

### Discussion Summary

- Reviewed the comprehensive `ai_storyteller_project_plan.md`.
- Agreed to adopt a phased MVP approach to manage the project's complexity and ensure timely delivery of a core, valuable product.
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Focus on the core storytelling experience. This includes:
    - Simple user management (email/password).
    - A story library with the first 5-10 stories.
    - "Normal Mode" continuous audio playback.
    - 2-3 high-quality, pre-generated AI voices (no custom cloning yet).
    - Manually parsing the first 5-10 stories from the source text.
- Agreed to maintain a daily summary of our interactions to keep track of progress.

### Implementation Summary

- **Project Structure:**
    - Created `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- **Backend Setup (`/backend`):
    - Initialized a Node.js project with `npm init -y`.
    - Installed Express.js, TypeScript, and related dependencies (`ts-node`, `@types/node`, `@types/express`).
    - Created a `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.
    - Implemented a basic Express server in `src/index.ts`.
    - Added a `start` script to `package.json` to run the server.
- **Frontend Setup (`/frontend`):
    - Successfully initialized a new Next.js 14 application using `create-next-app`.
    - The frontend is configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, the App Router, and a `src/` directory.

### Next Steps

- Begin processing the content from `Book 1_Mitra-bheda_The Separation of Friends.txt` to extract the first set of stories for the MVP.

### July 5th - End of Day Update

- **Content Strategy Enhancement:** Agreed to enrich the content processing pipeline from the start. Instead of just extracting text, we will generate a detailed JSON structure for each story including:
    - Age-specific summaries (3-7 and 8-12).
    - Age-appropriate moral lessons.
    - Defined pause points with guided questions for the AI storyteller.
    - Potential conversation triggers (questions a child might ask).
- **Initial Content Creation:**
    - Created the first structured data file at `backend/src/data/stories.json`.
    - Fully processed "Story 1: The Separation of Friends" into the new JSON format, creating a template for all subsequent stories.
- **Content Finalization (MVP):**
    - Renamed the story data file to `backend/src/data/book1_stories_1_to_5.json` for clarity.
    - Processed and added stories 2 through 5 to the file, completing the content set for the MVP.
    - Identified and fixed a syntax error in the JSON file to ensure it is valid.
    - Extracted the introductory narrative into a separate `backend/src/data/book1_preface.json` file to be used for a future "About" section.
