  "text": "The first of the five volumes of Panchatantra.\nPandit Vishnu Sharma begins the first part of the Panchatantra with the following introductory narrative:\n \nIn ancient times, there was a kingdom named Mahilaropyam in south India which was ruled by a king named Amarasakti. All his three princes were witless, and they became a matter of continued worry for him. On realization that his sons were lazy and had no interest in gaining knowledge, he summoned his minsters and said:\n \n\"You know I am not happy with my sons. According to men of learning an unborn son and a stillborn son are better than a son who is a dimwit. What good is a barren cow? A son who is stupid will bring dishonour to his father. How can I make them fit to be my successors? I turn to you for advice.\"\n \nOne of the ministers suggested the name of Vishnu Sharman, a great scholar enjoying the respect of hundreds of his disciples. \"He is the most competent person to tutor your children. Entrust them to his care and very soon you will see the change.\"\n \nThe king summoned Vishnu Sharman and pleaded with him \"Oh, venerable scholar, take pity on me and please train my sons into great scholars and I will make you the lord of hundred villages.\"\n \nVishnu Sharman said \"Oh, king, listen to my pledge. Hundred villages do not tempt me to vend learning. Count six months from today. If I do not make your children great scholars, you can ask me to change my name.\"\n \nThe king immediately called his sons and handed them to the care of the learned man. Sharman took them to his monastery where he started teaching them the five strategies (Panchatantra). Keeping his word, he finished the task the king entrusted him in six months. Since then, Panchatantra became popular all over the world as children's guide in solving problems of life.\n \nNow begins the Loss of Friends (first of the five strategies) series. These are stories that figure in a dialogue between two jackals named Karataka and Damanaka."
